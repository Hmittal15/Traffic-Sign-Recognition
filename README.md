# Traffic-Sign-Recognition

In this Python project example, we will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs, which is a very important task for all autonomous vehicles.

Approach followed to building this traffic sign classification model is as below:
* Explore the dataset
* Build a CNN model
* Train and validate the model
* Test the model with test dataset

For this project, I have used the public dataset available at Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign
